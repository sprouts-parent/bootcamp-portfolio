# Bootcamp Portfolio

## Description

The aim of the project is to develop my own portfolio, which will be used to showcase my future work to prospective employers. This is an important project for me which has allowed me to consolidate some key concepts from the Frontend Bootcamp so far.

I wanted to build this project to create a sleek, professional page so that employers can clearly be able to view information about me, get in contact with me and view my work. It solves the problem of having my information and work scattered around by provided one place for people to easily find this information about me.

I was challenged in adapting my layout to be responsive to other screen sizes using media queries within my stylesheet. I applied and developed my knowledge of flexbox and CSS grids from the first 2 modules of the bootcamp - it was challenging but I got there in the end!

I adapted my original wireframe partway through the project to make my portfolio page function better - as I feel I was ambitious at first with too many nested grids! In the end I settled for the three main sections displayed in blocks.

I still intend to make improvements to the features, layout and display of the portfolio as time goes on and I learn more!

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

The link to my deployed github portfolio is: https://sprouts-parent.github.io/bootcamp-portfolio/

My portfolio contains a navigation bar which will smooth scroll to the relevant section of the page once a link is clicked. The links in the navigation bar also change colour when the cursor hovers over them.

The "My Work" section will eventually contain links to my completed projects, but for now they are placeholders! Each application link is an image with a title overlay which appears when the cursor hovers over the image.

The "Contact Me" section contains 3 active links to contact me via email, connect with me via linkedin or view my github profile.
